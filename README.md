# Car-Leasing-Calculator

## The project contains only 3 files which are: 

### HTML (index.html):

* Defines a webpage structure with inputs for car leasing parameters (car type, lease period, car value, down payment) and sections to display leasing details.

* Links to external CSS (styles.css) for styling and JavaScript (script.js) for dynamic behavior.

### CSS (styles.css)

* Styles the webpage, ensuring a clean and responsive layout using flexbox.

* Defines visual properties like fonts, colors, spacing, and responsiveness using media queries (@media).

### JavaScript (script.js)

* Listens for user input changes on car value, down payment, and lease period.

* Calculates leasing details using APR formula (total cost, down payment amount, monthly installment, interest rate) based on user inputs (car type, car value, down payment, lease period).

* Updates the HTML elements dynamically to reflect the calculated leasing details.

* Initializes the calculator on page load (DOMContentLoaded), updates slider backgrounds, and calculates details based on initial values.
